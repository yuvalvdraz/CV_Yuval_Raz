      <h4 class="w3-center"><b>My musical journey</b></h4>
      <p class="w3-large">Music is one the central parts of my life and has been my passion since I was a little kid in the Netherlands. I started playing classical guitar when I was 13 and later switched to electric bass guitar. A few years back, my friends and I started a rock band named Aperco. Our band quickly became a success in the Israeli (and foreign) progressive rock community; our debut album received excellent reviews, our music was regularly played on the radio in Israel and abroad, and we even opened for the legendary rock band, Deep Purple when they played in Israel in 2016.</P>

      <h4 class="w3-center"><b>My love for nature and dogs</b></h4>
      <p class="w3-large">I love being in nature. It relaxes me, centers me and makes me appreciate the little things in life. We have two adopted dogs, Lilly (18) and Lemmy (4). Lemmy and I have a special connection. We enjoy exploring new places together. Every day we wake up at 05:15 AM and go for long walks in the fields. Lemmy loves running around, taking in the aromas of the morning dew and playing tug’O war with me.I am also a certified dog trainer, specializing in force free training. I enjoy helping dogs and their families live a more balanced and harmonious life together.</P>

      <p class="w3-large">We met almost ten years ago at Bar-Ilan University when we both studied Political Science. We had an instant connection based on the many things we have in common, such as our love for music, for dogs and for the works of JRR Tolkien. We love to explore, to travel the world and live the good life, but we also find pleasure in the little things in life, being together at home with our dogs, watching a good movie, cooking and watching geeky videos on YouTube.</P>
